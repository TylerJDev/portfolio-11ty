# Hello Friend, my name is Tyler! 🌇

I'm a Frontend Engineer, I specialize mostly in the frontend & making accessible applications.

## About Me 📖

I love building and learning, it's a part of the reason why I'm a developer. With the vastness that is web development, I enjoy trying out new things which may improve my workflow, or to get a better perspective. Things like making sure something is accessible for all is always key when I'm building for the web.
